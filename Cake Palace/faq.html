<h2 class="faq">FAQ</h2>
<div>
    <h3 class="question1">Q. Do you make custom cakes like Frozen character cake? And other character cakes?</h3>
    <p class="answer1">A. Yes, we do make custom cakes. Simple email us to inquire about pricing and feasibility.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="question1">Q. What payment currency are shown?</h3>
    <p class="answer1">A. All prices on Cake Palace and Cakes are shown in Myanmar (Kyats) and all orders will be processed in your local currency at the daily exchange rate. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="question1">Q. How many days in advance that I need to place my order?</h3>
    <p class="answer1">A. All the cakes are freshly baked the morning of delivery date, thus we require all orders be placed at least 3 business days in advance of the delivery date. For example, if you need the cake to be delivered on March 7 (Sunday), you will need to place your order no later than March 2nd (Tuesday). </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="question1">Q. Will Cake Palace confirm my order?</h3>
    <p class="answer1">A. Yes, as soon as your order has been processed through our secure, on-line, real-time credit card processing system, an e-mail message that confirms the order will be sent to you along with the confirmation of the date and time of your delivery.  </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="question1">Q. Can I cancel or change my order?</h3>
    <p class="answer1">A. As soon as we confirm your order, our bakery will begin the cake preparation process. Therefore, in most cases, we are unable to cancel or modify your order. If you need to make adjustments to your order, please email us at: sales@cakepalace.com to inquire if your order can be modified.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="question1">Q. What if I am not home when my purchase arrives?</h3>
    <p class="answer1">Unfortunately our delivery staff cannot be responsible for items that are left unattended. It would be best prior to making an order to confirm that someone will be available to receive it.<br><br>
    In addition, prior to ordering, please make sure the address is correct and there is a local contact number where the recipient can be contacted. If the delivery address is an apartment/condo unit, please also let us know of the front door buzzer code.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="question1">Q. Can I change the delivery address?</h3>
    <p class="answer1">A. We will be happy to change the delivery address as long as your order has not been delivered or is not on its way to being delivered. This must be done by e-mail , quoting your order confirmation number. Additional rerouting fee maybe charged by the courier.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="question1">Q. Why do you charge a delivery fee?</h3>
    <p class="answer1">A. All our delivery personnel are company staff, to ensure professionalism and proper on time delivery service. We never use contract drivers or third party drivers for all our deliveries. Our delivery fee includes proper cake packaging, food tampering label, and delivery service. </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="question1">Q. Why my confirmed time is differed from the time I have requested?</h3>
    <p class="answer1">A. Whenever possible, we try to accommodate your preferred time. However because we deliver multiple cakes along the route, your 2hrs delivery time window maybe different. Once order is placed, you will receive your confirmed delivery time window during the selected date. Currently we only deliver during regular business hours and delivery hours maybe shorten on holidays and weekends.  </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3 class="question1">Q. What happened if I received the wrong delivery?</h3>
    <p class="answer1">A. Mistakes do happened. If you have received a wrong order, please contact us via email on the day of delivery. We will try our best to replace your cake if possible or we will issue you a full refund if replacement is not possible.</p>
